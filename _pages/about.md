# 🌟 Introduction  

Hi all! My name is **Shangjian Yin**, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at South China Agricultural University (Sep. 2021 - Jun. 2025). I am currently seeking Fall 2025 CS PhD opportunities! You can find my CV here: [CV](../files/my_cv.pdf).  

Previously, my research interests focused on spoken language understanding (SLU) and its integration with large language models (LLMs). Currently, I am exploring the following areas:  

1. **Data-Driven LLMs**: Unleashing the power of synthetic data.  
2. **Small Language Models**: Enabling human-level AI for local use.  
3. **Multimodal LLMs**: Integrating multiple modalities into a unified framework.  

I previously served as a research assistant under the mentorship of Associate Professor **[Peijie Huang](https://dblp.org/pid/24/1023.html)** and **[Yuhong Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuhong-Xu-5)** at SCAU, where my research focused on SLU. Currently, I am interning at the University of Virginia under the guidance of Assistant Professor **[Yu Meng](https://yumeng5.github.io/)**, working on efficient LLMs. I am deeply grateful for their invaluable support throughout my academic journey!
