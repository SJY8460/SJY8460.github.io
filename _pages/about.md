I'm a junior student studying Computer Science at South China Agricultural University. My research interests consist of spoken language understanding (SLU), large language models (LLM), and multimodal natural language processing (NLP).

I am privileged to be mentored by Associate Professor Peijie Huang and Associate Professor Yuhong Xu at the School of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University.
