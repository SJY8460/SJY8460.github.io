I'm a junior student studying Computer Science at South China Agricultural University. My research interests consist of spoken language understanding (SLU), large language models (LLM), and multimodal natural language processing (NLP).

I am privileged to be mentored by Associate Professor Peijie Huang and Associate Professor Yuhong Xu at the School of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../files/cv.pdf).
